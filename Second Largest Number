# PROGRAM (Answer):

# 1st Method
n = int(input())
li = [int(input()) for i in range(n)]
li.sort()                # Sorting in Ascending Order
print(li[-2])            # 2nd value from last element


# # 2nd Method
# n = int(input())
# li = [int(input()) for i in range(n)]
# li.sort(reverse=True)     # Sorting in Descending Order
# print(li[1])              # 2nd value from first element



# # 3rd Method
# n = int(input())
# li = [int(input()) for i in range(n)]
# li.remove(max(li))
# print(max(li))
