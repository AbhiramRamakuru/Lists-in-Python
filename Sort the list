Input & Output Format:
Input consists of two integers and two lists.
First input consists of size of the first list.
Second inputs corresponds to the elements of the first list.
Third input consists of size of the second list.
Fourth inputs corresponds to the elements of the second list.
Output consists of the sorted elements

# PROGRAM (Answer):

#python
n1 = int(input())
List1 = [int(input()) for i in range(n1)]
n2 = int(input())
List2 = [int(input()) for i in range(n2)]


# 1st Method
List1.extend(List2)
List1.sort()
print(f"Sorted list is: {List1}")

# # 2nd Method
# List1 = List1 + List2
# List1.sort()
# print(f"Sorted list is: {List1}")

# # 3rd Method
# for j in List2:
#     List1.append(j)
# List1.sort()
# print(f"Sorted list is: {List1}")
